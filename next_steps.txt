1/ I'll fix the cosmetic issue where triggered_by always shows 'manual' instead of distinguishing between manual and scheduled executions. The issue is that the execute endpoint doesn't know whether it was called manually or from a scheduled Airflow DAG. I'll add a query parameter to the endpoint to allow specifying the trigger source.

2/ Remove play button from ETL Jobs list and change the date from created date to last executed date

3/ Update status of ETL jobs to the following; 
- created but never run - draft
- run / running to schedule - live
- paused - paused 

Add a way to pause an ETL job (default should be the play button that already exists, but if clicked it should change status to paused)

Sense check if this makes sense before implementing


4/ add google sheets functionality 


5/ fix transformations 
- check full list of transformations on duco and replicate 
- add description of transformations 
- align etl job and wizard (they should be the same) 
- add custom column / calculated column
- make sure we have updated date / inserted date by default in all cases
