1/ continue plan - Implementation Plan
Critical Considerations:
DDL Generation: Already handles primary keys correctly (line 111-114 in ddl_generator.py)
Upsert Keys vs Primary Keys: Need to ensure upsert keys MUST be a subset of primary key columns
Validation Timing:
Frontend validation (before job creation)
Backend validation (before DDL generation)
Runtime validation (before execution)
User Experience: Clear error messages at each stage

2/ Fix timestamp logic for created_at and updated_at
I created a table, populated it in one ETL job - INSERT
Then i created a new ETL job - UPSERT - and changed 2 rows in the googlesheet
- expected -> only 2 rows would update in the table, the created_at timestamp would stay the same as the original created_at and the updated_at timestamp would update.
- 2 rows would have one updated_at, the rest would have another

4/ replace CSV upload with Get Started, and then just trigger the wizard
