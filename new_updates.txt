1/ expander on column names in DDL preview doesn't do anything and crashes the page

2/ flow should be changed as follows 

Step 1: user populates job details and uplaods file - preview displays (main page)

Step 2: User selects destination and does column mappings (Side window)

Step 3: Schedule is selected (new page in side window). Select batch size as part of schedule or manual run. 

Other points: 
- when a csv has been uploaded and the preview displays, don't show upload CSV card anymore
- Move the buttons for configure etl and upload new csv to the top of the preview card
